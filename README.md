KendoGlobalization
==================

This is a sample project I used to experiment with kendo's globalization to see how we should handle globalization on our website. This example shows how to do globalization for dates, currency and percents in kendo controls. Select a language in the combo box and the grid will change to the correct date, currency and percent formats. If you select a row in the grid the kendo controls will get populated with the correct formats.
